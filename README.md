This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2023 challenges](https://adventofcode.com/2023), written in JavaScript.

## Structure

Each day's solution is organized into its own folder, named `dayXX`.

Inside each day's folder, you'll find the following:

- **`input.txt`**: The input data provided for the challenge.
- **`p1.js`**: JavaScript file containing the solution for Part 1 of the challenge.
- **`p2.js`**: JavaScript file containing the solution for Part 2 of the challenge.

## How to Run

To run a specific day's solution, make sure you have Node.js installed. Open a terminal in the day's folder and run the following command:

```bash
node p1.js
# or
node p2.js
```

## Disclaimer

These solutions are my own and may not be the most optimized or elegant. The goal is to practice problem-solving and coding skills.

Happy coding and happy Advent of Code!
